Some Notes about my code:

I used python, including two popular libraries.(Pandas, Numpy)

Put the tarin and test data in the same directory as the code, and it will output a txt file.(Which is the answer predict by my model.)

By the way, my model used K-NN, so a lot of calculation was done. It normally takes me about 40 min to calculate the answer. So I include a counter in my code indicate how many of the data the program currently run through out of 4960.
